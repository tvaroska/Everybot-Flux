## Command Architecture

### Command Base Structure
All commands follow the standard WPILib Command framework:

```java
public class ExampleCommand extends Command {
    // Constructor with subsystem dependencies
    public ExampleCommand(Subsystem subsystem) {
        addRequirements(subsystem);
    }
    
    // Lifecycle methods
    public void initialize() { }          // Setup when scheduled
    public void execute() { }             // Called every 20ms while active  
    public void end(boolean interrupted) { } // Cleanup when finished
    public boolean isFinished() { }       // Termination condition
}
```

### Subsystem Integration
Commands interact with the following subsystems:

- **DriveSubsystem**: Robot movement and navigation
- **ArmSubsystem**: Arm positioning and control  
- **RollerSubsystem**: Game piece manipulation
- **ShooterSubsystem**: Precision shooting mechanisms
- **ClimberSubsystem**: Endgame climbing operations

### Common Patterns

#### Continuous Commands
Many commands run continuously until interrupted:
```java
public boolean isFinished() {
    return false;  // Never finishes, must be interrupted
}
```

#### Timed Commands  
Some commands use internal timers for sequences:
```java
public boolean isFinished() {
    return timer.get() >= targetTime;
}
```

#### Multi-Phase Commands
Complex commands implement state machines:
```java
public void execute() {
    if (phase1Condition) {
        // Phase 1 actions
    } else if (phase2Condition) {
        // Phase 2 actions
    }
}
```

## Configuration and Tuning

### Constants Integration
Commands use centralized constants for easy tuning:

```java
// Speed and timing constants
RollerConstants.ROLLER_ALGAE_IN = 0.8
ArmConstants.ARM_TIME_UP = 360ms
ShooterConstants.SpeedUp1 = 2110 RPM
```

### SmartDashboard Integration
Advanced commands support real-time tuning:

```java
// Example from AlgieShootCommand
speed = SmartDashboard.getNumber("Set RPM Up 1", defaultValue);
timing = SmartDashboard.getNumber("Shoot Start Time", defaultValue);
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Button Binding Patterns

#### Continuous Commands (whileTrue)
```java
// For commands that should run while button is held
controller.rightBumper().whileTrue(new AlgieInCommand(roller, shooter));
```

#### Instant Commands (onTrue)  
```java
// For commands that run once when button is pressed
controller.a().onTrue(new ArmUpCommand(arm));
```

#### Timed Commands with Safety
```java
// For autonomous with timeout protection
new AlgieShootCommand(shooter, roller, 0).withTimeout(5.0);
```

### Command Composition

#### Sequential Operations
```java
Commands.sequence(
    new ArmDownCommand(arm),
    new CoralOutCommand(roller).withTimeout(2.0),
    new ArmUpCommand(arm)
).schedule();
```

#### Parallel Operations
```java
Commands.parallel(
    new ArmUpCommand(arm),
    new AlgieInCommand(roller, shooter)
).schedule();
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Execution Timing
- **Command Scheduler**: ~50Hz (20ms cycle time)
- **Response Time**: Single-cycle response for most commands
- **Safety Timeouts**: Autonomous commands include timeout protection

### Resource Management
- **Subsystem Requirements**: Prevents conflicting commands
- **Memory Efficiency**: Lightweight command objects
- **Power Management**: Current limiting and voltage compensation

## Competition Best Practices

### Reliability
- **Simple Designs**: Prefer simple, proven command structures
- **Timeout Protection**: Always use timeouts in autonomous
- **Defensive Programming**: Handle edge cases and failures gracefully

### Performance
- **Tuning**: Use SmartDashboard for real-time parameter adjustment
- **Practice**: Extensive testing on competition-like conditions
- **Monitoring**: Log critical parameters for post-match analysis

### Strategy
- **Modular Design**: Commands can be combined for complex strategies
- **Fallback Options**: Simple commands as backup for complex ones
- **Alliance Coordination**: Consider impact on alliance partners

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Commands
1. **Identify Requirements**: Determine subsystems and functionality needed
2. **Create Command Class**: Follow standard WPILib patterns
3. **Implement Lifecycle**: Initialize, execute, end, and finish methods
4. **Add Safety Features**: Timeouts, bounds checking, error handling
5. **Document Thoroughly**: Update this documentation
6. **Test Extensively**: Verify behavior in all scenarios

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual command behavior
- **Integration Testing**: Test command interactions
- **Competition Simulation**: Test under realistic conditions
- **Edge Cases**: Verify behavior during failures and interruptions

### Maintenance
- **Regular Review**: Keep documentation current with code changes
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track command execution times and success rates
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust constants based on competition experience
- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean, readable, well-commented code
